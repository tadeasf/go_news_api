## How to develop

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `go mod download`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```sh
   PG_HOST=your_postgres_host
   PG_USER=your_postgres_user
   PG_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
   PG_DB=your_postgres_database
   PG_PORT=your_postgres_port
   NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
   GNEWS_API_KEY=your_gnews_key
   GIN_MODE=debug
   ```

4. Run the server: `go run main.go`

## How to test

Currently, there are no automated tests implemented. This is an area for future improvement.

## How to build

To build the project, run the following command in the root directory:

```sh
go build -o go-news-api
```

This will create an executable named `go-news-api` in the current directory.
